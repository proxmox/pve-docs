`comment`: `<string>` ::

Description.

`group`: `<string>` ::

The HA group identifier.

`max_relocate`: `<integer> (0 - N)` ('default =' `1`)::

Maximal number of service relocate tries when a service fails to start.

`max_restart`: `<integer> (0 - N)` ('default =' `1`)::

Maximal number of tries to restart the service on a node after its start failed.

`state`: `<disabled | enabled | started | stopped>` ('default =' `started`)::

Requested resource state. The CRM reads this state and acts accordingly.
Please note that `enabled` is just an alias for `started`.
+
`started`;;
+
The CRM tries to start the resource. Service state is
set to `started` after successful start. On node failures, or when start
fails, it tries to recover the resource.  If everything fails, service
state it set to `error`.
+
`stopped`;;
+
The CRM tries to keep the resource in `stopped` state, but it
still tries to relocate the resources on node failures.
+
`disabled`;;
+
The CRM tries to put the resource in `stopped` state, but does not try
to relocate the resources on node failures. The main purpose of this
state is error recovery, because it is the only way to move a resource out
of the `error` state.
