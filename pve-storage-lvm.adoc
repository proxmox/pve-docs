Storage pool type: `lvm`

LVM is a lightweight software layer that sits on top of hard disks and
partitions. It can be used to divide available disk space into smaller logical
volumes.

Another use case is placing LVM on top of a large iSCSI LUN (Logical Unit
Number) or a SAN (Storage Area Network) connected via Fibre Channel.
This allows you to easily manage the space on the iSCSI LUN, which would
otherwise be impossible because the iSCSI specification does not define a
management interface for space allocation.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LVM backend supports the common storage properties `content`, `nodes`,
`disable`, and the following LVM specific properties:

`vgname`::

LVM volume group name. This must point to an existing volume group.

`base`::

Base volume. This volume is automatically activated before accessing
the storage. This is mostly useful when the LVM volume group resides
on a remote iSCSI server.

`saferemove`::

Called "Wipe Removed Volumes" in the web UI. Zero-out data when removing LVs.
When removing a volume, this makes sure that all data gets erased and cannot be
accessed by other LVs created later (which happen to be assigned the same
physical extents). This is a costly operation, but may be required as a security
measure in certain environments.

`saferemove_throughput`::

Wipe throughput (`cstream -t` parameter value).

`snapshot-as-volume-chain`::

Set this flag to enable snapshot support for virtual machines on LVM with a
volume backing chain.
With this setting, taking a snapshot persists the current state under the
snapshot's name and starts a new volume backed by the snapshot.
+
A volume based on a snapshot references its parent snapshot volume as its
backing volume and records only the differences to that backing volume.
Snapshot volumes are currently thick-provisioned LVM logical volumes.
+
This design avoids issues with native LVM snapshots, such as significant
input/output (I/O) penalties and unexpected, dangerous behavior when running out
of pre-allocated space.
+
Snapshots as volume chains provide vendor-agnostic support for snapshots on any
storage system that supports block storage. This includes iSCSI and Fibre
Channel-attached SANs.
+
Note that, although this feature relies on qcow2, it only uses qcow2's ability
to layer multiple volumes in a backing chain, not qcow2's snapshot
functionality.
The snapshot functionality is managed by the PVE storage system.
+
Enabling or disabling this flag only affects newly created virtual disk volumes.
+
For efficient support of `snapshot-as-volume-chain`, the backing storage must
support thin-provisioning and discard. Each snapshot will appear to use the
full volume size on the PVE side, but the actual space usage on the underlying
storage will be smaller if those requirements are met.

WARNING: Snapshots as volume chains are currently a **technology preview** in {pve}.

File naming conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backend use basically the same naming conventions as the ZFS pool
backend.

 vm-<VMID>-<NAME>      // normal VM images

Storage Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LVM is a typical block storage system.
Unfortunately, regular LVM snapshots are inefficient because they interfere with
all write operations within the entire volume group while the snapshot is
active, which causes significant I/O degradation.
This is why LVM does not support linked clones, and why {pve} added support for
snapshots as volume chains. This feature manages the snapshot volume through the
storage plugin and uses qcow2 to layer separate volumes as a backing chain. This
creates a single disk state that is exposed to the guest.

A benefit of LVM is that it can be used with shared storage.
For example, an iSCSI LUN. The backend implements proper cluster-wide locking if
the storage is marked as shared in the configuration.

TIP: You can use the LVM-thin backend for non-shared local storage. It supports
snapshots and linked clones.
