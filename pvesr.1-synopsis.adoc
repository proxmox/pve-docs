[[cli_pvesr]]
*pvesr* `<COMMAND> [ARGS] [OPTIONS]`

[[cli_pvesr_create-local-job]]
*pvesr create-local-job* `<id> <target>` `[OPTIONS]`

Create a new replication job

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

Replication Job ID. The ID is composed of a Guest ID and a job number, separated by a hyphen, i.e. '<GUEST>-<JOBNUM>'.

`<target>`: `<string>` ::

Target node.

`--comment` `<string>` ::

Description.

`--disable` `<boolean>` ::

Flag to disable/deactivate the entry.

`--rate` `<number> (1 - N)` ::

Rate limit in mbps (megabytes per second) as floating point number.

`--remove_job` `<full | local>` ::

Mark the replication job for removal. The job will remove all local replication snapshots. When set to 'full', it also tries to remove replicated volumes on the target. The job then removes itself from the configuration file.

`--source` `<string>` ::

For internal use, to detect if the guest was stolen.

Mark replication job for removal.

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

Replication Job ID. The ID is composed of a Guest ID and a job number, separated by a hyphen, i.e. '<GUEST>-<JOBNUM>'.

`--force` `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

Will remove the jobconfig entry, but will not cleanup.

Keep replicated data at target (do not remove).

[[cli_pvesr_prepare-local-job]]
*pvesr prepare-local-job* `<id> [<extra-args>]` `[OPTIONS]`

Prepare for starting a replication job. This is called on the target node
before replication starts. This call is for internal use, and return a JSON
object on stdout. The method first test if VM <vmid> reside on the local
node. If so, stop immediately. After that the method scans all volume IDs
for snapshots, and removes all replications snapshots with timestamps
different than <last_sync>. It also removes any unused volumes. Returns a
hash with boolean markers for all volumes with existing replication
snapshots.

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

Replication Job ID. The ID is composed of a Guest ID and a job number, separated by a hyphen, i.e. '<GUEST>-<JOBNUM>'.

`<extra-args>`: `<array>` ::

`--force` `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

Allow to remove all existion volumes (empty volume list).

`--last_sync` `<integer> (0 - N)` ::
