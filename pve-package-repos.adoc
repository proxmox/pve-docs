Package Repositories
--------------------
ifdef::wiki[]
:pve-toplevel:
endif::wiki[]

{pve} uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool[APT] as its
package management tool like any other Debian-based system.

{pve} automatically checks for package updates on a daily basis. The `root@pam`
user is notified via email about available updates. From the GUI, the
'Changelog' button can be used to see more details about an selected update.

Repositories in {pve}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Repositories are a collection of software packages, they can be used to install
new software, but are also important to get new updates.

NOTE: You need valid Debian and Proxmox repositories to get the latest
security updates, bug fixes and new features.

APT Repositories are defined in the file `/etc/apt/sources.list` in the legacy
single-line format and in `.sources` files placed in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`
for the modern deb822 multi-line format, see
xref:sysadmin_apt_repo_formats[Repository Formats] for details.

[[_repository_management]]
Repository Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[thumbnail="screenshot/gui-node-repositories.png"]

Since Proxmox VE 7, you can check the repository state in the web interface.
The node summary panel shows a high level status overview, while the separate
'Repository' panel shows in-depth status and list of all configured
repositories.

Basic repository management, for example, activating or deactivating a
repository, is also supported.

The available packages from a repository are acquired by running `apt update`.
Updates can be installed directly using `apt`, or via the GUI (Node -> Updates).

[[sysadmin_apt_repo_formats]]
Repository Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Package repositories can be configured in the source list
'/etc/apt/sources.list' and the files contained in '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/'.

There are two formats supported:

single line::

In a single-line `sources.list` file, each line defines a package repository.
Empty lines are ignored. A `#` character anywhere on a line marks the remainder
of that line as a comment.
This is the legacy format. Since Debian 13 Trixie apt will complain about using
this format. You can automatically migrate most repositories using the `apt
modernize-sources` command.

deb822::

In the multi-line format `repo.sources` file each entry consists of multiple
lines of key-value pairs. A file can include multiple entries by separating each
group with a blank line. This is the modern format.

Available Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

{pve} provides three different package repositories in addition to requiring the
base Debian repositories.

[[sysadmin_enterprise_repo]]
{pve} Enterprise Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the recommended repository and available for all {pve} subscription
users. It contains the most stable packages and is suitable for production use.
The `pve-enterprise` repository is enabled by default:

.File `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.sources`

Please note that you need a valid subscription key to access the
`pve-enterprise` repository. We offer different support levels, which you can
find further details about at {pricing-url}.

NOTE: You can disable this repository by adding `Enabled: False` in a line of
of its own to the file. This prevents error messages if your host does
not have a subscription key. Please configure the `pve-no-subscription`
repository in that case.

[[sysadmin_no_subscription_repo]]
{pve} No-Subscription Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the name suggests, you do not need a subscription key to access this
repository. It can be used for testing and non-production use. It's not
recommended to use this on production servers, as these packages are not always
as heavily tested and validated.

We recommend to configure this repository in
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources`.

NOTE: Remember that you will always need the base Debian repositories in
addition to a {pve} Proxmox repository.

[[sysadmin_test_repo]]
{pve} Test Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository contains the latest packages and is primarily used by developers
to test new features. To configure it, add the following stanza to the file
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources`:

WARNING: The `pve-test` repository should (as the name implies) only be used for
testing new features or bug fixes.


[[sysadmin_package_repositories_ceph]]
Ceph Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ceph-related packages are kept up to date with a preconfigured Ceph enterprise
repository. Preinstalled packages enable connecting to an external Ceph
cluster and adding its xref:ceph_rados_block_devices[RBD] or
xref:storage_cephfs[CephFS] pools as storage. You can also build a
xref:chapter_hyper_converged_infrastructure[hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI)]
by running xref:chapter_pveceph[Ceph] on top of the {pve} cluster.

Information from this chapter is helpful in the following cases:

Installing Ceph to build an HCI::
Decide on a below described repository and recent Ceph release, which you can
then select in the xref:pve_ceph_install_wizard[web-based wizard or the CLI tool].

Already running the HCI and want to upgrade to the succeeding _Ceph_ major release::
Please follow the related {webwiki-url}Category:Ceph_Upgrade[Ceph upgrade guide].

Already running the HCI and want to upgrade to the succeeding _{pve}_ major release::
In an HCI each {pve} major release requires a corresponding minimum Ceph major
release, please follow the related
{webwiki-url}Category:Upgrade[{pve} upgrade guide].

Not running an HCI but using an external Ceph cluster::
To install newer packages used to connect to Ceph, apply available system
updates, decide on a repository and Ceph release listed below, add it to your
node via the __xref:_repository_management[Repository]__ panel, apply newly
available system updates, verify the result by running `ceph --version` and
disable the old Ceph repository.

//TODO: At Ceph or PVE release changes, update:
//      - below variables (used in below headings and example ceph.sources files)
//      - the Ceph release table

[[sysadmin_debian_firmware_repo]]
Debian Firmware Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with Debian Bookworm ({pve} 8) non-free firmware (as defined by
https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines[DFSG]) has been moved to the
newly created Debian repository component `non-free-firmware`.

Since {pve} 9 this repository is enabled by default for new installations to
ensure they can get xref:sysadmin_firmware_cpu[Early OS Microcode Updates].

You can also acquire need additional
xref:sysadmin_firmware_runtime_files[Runtime Firmware Files] not already
included in the pre-installed package `pve-firmware`.

To be able to install packages from this component, run
`editor /etc/apt/sources.list`, append `non-free-firmware` to the end of each
`.debian.org` repository line and run `apt update`.

If you upgraded your {pve} 9 install from a previous version of {pve} and have
modernized your package repositories to the new deb822-style, you will need to
adapt `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources` instead. Run `editor
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources` and add `non-free-firmware` to the lines
starting with `Components:` of each stanza.

NOTE: Modernizing your package repositories is recommended. Otherwise, `apt` on
Debian Trixie will complain. You can run `apt modernize-sources` to do so.

[[repos_secure_apt]]
SecureApt
~~~~~~~~~

The 'Release' files in the repositories are signed with GnuPG. APT is using
these signatures to verify that all packages are from a trusted source.

If you install {pve} from an official ISO image, the key for verification is
already installed.

If you install {pve} on top of Debian, download and install
the key with the following commands:

----
 # wget https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-archive-keyring-trixie.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
----

NOTE: The `wget` command above adds the keyring for Proxmox releases based on
Debian Trixie. Once the `proxmox-archive-keyring` package is installed, it will
manage this file. At that point, the hashes below may no longer match the hashes
of this file, as keys for new Proxmox releases get added or removed. This is
intended, `apt` will ensure that only trusted keys are being used.
*Modifying this file is discouraged once `proxmox-archive-keyring` is installed.*

Verify the checksum afterwards with the `sha512sum` CLI tool:

----
# sha256sum /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
 136673be77aba35dcce385b28737689ad64fd785a797e57897589aed08db6e45 /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
----

or the `md5sum` CLI tool:

----
# md5sum /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
77c8b1166d15ce8350102ab1bca2fcbf /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
----

NOTE: Make sure the path you install the key to matches the `Signed-By:` lines
in your repository stanzas.
