`arch`: `<amd64 | arm64 | armhf | i386 | riscv32 | riscv64>` ('default =' `amd64`)::

OS architecture type.

`cmode`: `<console | shell | tty>` ('default =' `tty`)::

Console mode. By default, the console command tries to open a connection to one of the available tty devices. By setting cmode to 'console' it tries to attach to /dev/console instead. If you set cmode to 'shell', it simply invokes a shell inside the container (no login).

`console`: `<boolean>` ('default =' `1`)::

Attach a console device (/dev/console) to the container.

`cores`: `<integer> (1 - 8192)` ::

The number of cores assigned to the container. A container can use all available cores by default.

`cpulimit`: `<number> (0 - 8192)` ('default =' `0`)::

Limit of CPU usage.
+
NOTE: If the computer has 2 CPUs, it has a total of '2' CPU time. Value '0' indicates no CPU limit.

`cpuunits`: `<integer> (0 - 500000)` ('default =' `cgroup v1: 1024, cgroup v2: 100`)::

CPU weight for a container. Argument is used in the kernel fair scheduler. The larger the number is, the more CPU time this container gets. Number is relative to the weights of all the other running guests.

`debug`: `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

Try to be more verbose. For now this only enables debug log-level on start.

`description`: `<string>` ::

Description for the Container. Shown in the web-interface CT's summary. This is saved as comment inside the configuration file.

`dev[n]`: `[[path=]<Path>] [,deny-write=<1|0>] [,gid=<integer>] [,mode=<Octal access mode>] [,uid=<integer>]` ::

Device to pass through to the container

`deny-write`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Deny the container to write to the device

`gid`=`<integer> (0 - N)` ;;

Group ID to be assigned to the device node

`mode`=`<Octal access mode>` ;;

Access mode to be set on the device node

`path`=`<Path>` ;;

Path to the device to pass through to the container

`uid`=`<integer> (0 - N)` ;;

User ID to be assigned to the device node

`features`: `[force_rw_sys=<1|0>] [,fuse=<1|0>] [,keyctl=<1|0>] [,mknod=<1|0>] [,mount=<fstype;fstype;...>] [,nesting=<1|0>]` ::

Allow containers access to advanced features.

`force_rw_sys`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Mount /sys in unprivileged containers as `rw` instead of `mixed`. This can break networking under newer (>= v245) systemd-network use.

`fuse`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Allow using 'fuse' file systems in a container. Note that interactions between fuse and the freezer cgroup can potentially cause I/O deadlocks.

`keyctl`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

For unprivileged containers only: Allow the use of the keyctl() system call. This is required to use docker inside a container. By default unprivileged containers will see this system call as non-existent. This is mostly a workaround for systemd-networkd, as it will treat it as a fatal error when some keyctl() operations are denied by the kernel due to lacking permissions. Essentially, you can choose between running systemd-networkd or docker.

`mknod`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Allow unprivileged containers to use mknod() to add certain device nodes. This requires a kernel with seccomp trap to user space support (5.3 or newer). This is experimental.

`mount`=`<fstype;fstype;...>` ;;

Allow mounting file systems of specific types. This should be a list of file system types as used with the mount command. Note that this can have negative effects on the container's security. With access to a loop device, mounting a file can circumvent the mknod permission of the devices cgroup, mounting an NFS file system can block the host's I/O completely and prevent it from rebooting, etc.

`nesting`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Allow nesting. Best used with unprivileged containers with additional id mapping. Note that this will expose procfs and sysfs contents of the host to the guest. This is also required by systemd to isolate services.
