Specifies network interfaces for the container.

`bridge`=`<bridge>` ;;

Bridge to attach the network device to.

`firewall`=`<boolean>` ;;

Controls whether this interface's firewall rules should be used.

`gw`=`<GatewayIPv4>` ;;

Default gateway for IPv4 traffic.

`gw6`=`<GatewayIPv6>` ;;

Default gateway for IPv6 traffic.

`host-managed`=`<boolean>` ;;

Whether this interface's IP configuration should be managed by the host. When enabled, the host (rather than the container) is responsible for the interface's IP configuration. The container should not run its own DHCP client or network manager on this interface. This is useful for containers that lack an internal network management stack, like many application containers.

`hwaddr`=`<XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX>` ;;

A common MAC address with the I/G (Individual/Group) bit not set.

`ip`=`<(IPv4/CIDR|dhcp|manual)>` ;;

IPv4 address in CIDR format.

`ip6`=`<(IPv6/CIDR|auto|dhcp|manual)>` ;;

IPv6 address in CIDR format.

`link_down`=`<boolean>` ;;

Whether this interface should be disconnected (like pulling the plug).

`mtu`=`<integer> (64 - 65535)` ;;

Maximum transfer unit of the interface. (lxc.network.mtu)

`name`=`<string>` ;;

Name of the network device as seen from inside the container. (lxc.network.name)

`rate`=`<mbps>` ;;

Apply rate limiting to the interface

`tag`=`<integer> (1 - 4094)` ;;

VLAN tag for this interface.

`trunks`=`<vlanid[;vlanid...]>` ;;

VLAN ids to pass through the interface

`type`=`<veth>` ;;

Network interface type.
