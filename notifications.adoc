Overview
--------

[thumbnail="screenshot/gui-datacenter-notification-overview.png"]

* {pve} emits xref:notification_events[Notification Events] in case of storage
  replication failures, node fencing, finished/failed backups and other events.
  These events are processed based on the global notification settings. Each
  notification event includes metadata, such as a timestamp, severity level,
  type, and additional event-specific fields.
* xref:notification_matchers[Notification Matchers] route a notification event
  to one or more notification targets. A matcher can have match rules to
  selectively route based on the metadata of a notification event.
* xref:notification_targets[Notification Targets] are a destination to which a
  notification event is routed to by a matcher.  There are multiple types of
  target, mail-based (Sendmail and SMTP) and Gotify.

The global notification settings can be configured in the GUI under Datacenter →
Notifications. The configuration is stored in `/etc/pve/notifications.cfg` and
`/etc/pve/priv/notifications.cfg` - the latter contains sensitive configuration
options such as passwords or authentication tokens for notification targets and
can only be read by `root`.

[[notification_targets]]
Notification Targets
--------------------

{pve} offers multiple types of notification targets.

[[notification_targets_sendmail]]
Sendmail
~~~~~~~~

[thumbnail="screenshot/gui-datacenter-notification-sendmail.png"]

The sendmail binary is a program commonly found on Unix-like operating systems
that handles the sending of email messages.
It is a command-line utility that allows users and applications to send emails
directly from the command line or from within scripts.

The sendmail notification target uses the `sendmail` binary to send emails to a
list of configured users or email addresses. If a user is selected as a
recipient, the email address configured in user's settings will be used.
For the `root@pam` user, this is the email address entered during installation.
A user's email address can be configured in `Datacenter → Permissions → Users`.
If a user has no associated email address, no email will be sent.

NOTE: In standard {pve} installations, the `sendmail` binary is provided by
Postfix. It may be necessary to configure Postfix so that it can deliver mails
correctly - for example by setting an external mail relay (smart host).  In case
of failed delivery, check the system logs for messages logged by the Postfix
daemon.

The configuration for Sendmail target plugins has the following options:

* `mailto`: E-Mail address to which the notification shall be sent to. Can be
  set multiple times to accommodate multiple recipients.
* `mailto-user`: Users to which emails shall be sent to. The user's email
  address will be looked up in `user.cfg`. Can be set multiple times to
  accommodate multiple recipients.
* `author`: Sets the author of the E-Mail. Defaults to `Proxmox VE`.
* `from-address`: Sets the from address of the E-Mail. If the parameter is not
  set, the plugin will fall back to the `email_from` setting from
  `datacenter.cfg`. If that is also not set, the plugin will default to
  `root@$hostname`, where `$hostname` is the hostname of the node.
  The `From` header in the email will be set to `$author <$from-address>`.
* `comment`: Comment for this target

Example configuration (`/etc/pve/notifications.cfg`):
----
sendmail: example
        mailto-user root@pam
        mailto-user admin@pve
        mailto max@example.com
        from-address pve1@example.com
        comment Send to multiple users/addresses
----

[[notification_targets_smtp]]
SMTP
~~~~

[thumbnail="screenshot/gui-datacenter-notification-smtp.png"]

SMTP notification targets can send emails directly to an SMTP mail relay.
This target does not use the system's MTA to deliver emails.
Similar to sendmail targets, if a user is selected as a recipient, the user's
configured email address will be used.

NOTE: Unlike sendmail targets, SMTP targets do not have any queuing/retry
mechanism in case of a failed mail delivery.

The configuration for SMTP target plugins has the following options:

* `mailto`: E-Mail address to which the notification shall be sent to. Can be
  set multiple times to accommodate multiple recipients.
* `mailto-user`: Users to which emails shall be sent to. The user's email
  address will be looked up in `user.cfg`. Can be set multiple times to
  accommodate multiple recipients.
* `author`: Sets the author of the E-Mail. Defaults to `Proxmox VE`.
* `from-address`: Sets the From-address of the email. SMTP relays might require
  that this address is owned by the user in order to avoid spoofing.  The `From`
  header in the email will be set to `$author <$from-address>`.
* `username`: Username to use during authentication. If no username is set,
  no authentication will be performed. The PLAIN and LOGIN authentication
  methods are supported.
* `password`: Password to use when authenticating.
* `mode`: Sets the encryption mode (`insecure`, `starttls` or `tls`). Defaults
  to `tls`.
* `server`: Address/IP of the SMTP relay.
* `port`: The port to connect to. If not set, the used port .
   Defaults to 25 (`insecure`), 465 (`tls`) or 587 (`starttls`), depending on
   the value of `mode`.
* `comment`: Comment for this target

Example configuration (`/etc/pve/notifications.cfg`):
----
smtp: example
        mailto-user root@pam
        mailto-user admin@pve
        mailto max@example.com
        from-address pve1@example.com
        username pve1
        server mail.example.com
        mode starttls

[[notification_targets_gotify]]
Gotify
~~~~~~

[thumbnail="screenshot/gui-datacenter-notification-gotify.png"]

http://gotify.net[Gotify] is an open-source self-hosted notification server that
allows you to send and receive push notifications to various devices and
applications. It provides a simple API and web interface, making it easy to
integrate with different platforms and services.

The configuration for Gotify target plugins has the following options:

* `server`: The base URL of the Gotify server, e.g. `http://<ip>:8888`
* `token`: The authentication token. Tokens can be generated within the Gotify
  web interface.
* `comment`: Comment for this target

NOTE: The Gotify target plugin will respect the HTTP proxy settings from the
xref:datacenter_configuration_file[datacenter configuration]

Example configuration (`/etc/pve/notifications.cfg`):
----
gotify: example
        server http://gotify.example.com:8888
        comment Send to multiple users/addresses
----

The matching entry in `/etc/pve/priv/notifications.cfg`, containing the
secret token:
----
gotify: example
        token somesecrettoken

[[notification_targets_webhook]]
Webhook
~~~~~~~

Webhook notification targets perform HTTP requests to a configurable URL.

The following configuration options are available:

* `url`: The URL to which to perform the HTTP requests.
  Supports templating to inject message contents, metadata and secrets.
* `method`: HTTP Method to use (POST/PUT/GET)
* `header`: Array of HTTP headers that should be set for the request.
  Supports templating to inject message contents, metadata and secrets.
* `body`: HTTP body that should be sent.
  Supports templating to inject message contents, metadata and secrets.
* `secret`: Array of secret key-value pairs. These will be stored in
  a protected configuration file only readable by root. Secrets can be accessed
  in body/header/URL templates via the `secrets` namespace.
* `comment`: Comment for this target.

For configuration options that support templating, the
https://handlebarsjs.com/[Handlebars] syntax can be used to
access the following properties:

* `{{ title }}`: The rendered notification title
* `{{ message }}`: The rendered notification body
* `{{ severity }}`: The severity of the notification (`info`, `notice`,
  `warning`, `error`, `unknown`)
* `{{ timestamp }}`: The notification's timestamp as a UNIX epoch (in seconds).
* `{{ fields.<name> }}`: Sub-namespace for any metadata fields of the
  notification. For instance, `fields.type` contains the notification type -
  for all available fields refer to xref:notification_events[Notification Events].
* `{{ secrets.<name> }}`: Sub-namespace for secrets. For instance, a secret
  named `token` is accessible via `secrets.token`.

For convenience, the following helpers are available:

* `{{ url-encode <value/property> }}`: URL-encode a property/literal.
* `{{ escape <value/property> }}`: Escape any control characters that cannot be
  safely represented as a JSON string.
* `{{ json <value/property> }}`: Render a value as JSON. This can be useful to
  pass a whole sub-namespace (e.g. `fields`) as a part of a JSON payload (e.g.
  `{{ json fields }}`).

[[notification_matchers]]
Notification Matchers
---------------------

[thumbnail="screenshot/gui-datacenter-notification-matcher.png"]

Notification matchers route notifications to notification targets based on their
matching rules. These rules can match certain properties of a notification, such
as the timestamp (`match-calendar`), the severity of the notification
(`match-severity`) or metadata fields (`match-field`).
If a notification is matched by a matcher, all targets configured for the
matcher will receive the notification.

An arbitrary number of matchers can be created, each with with their own
matching rules and targets to notify.
Every target is notified at most once for every notification, even if the target
is used in multiple matchers.

A matcher without any matching rules is always true; the configured targets will
always be notified.
----
matcher: always-matches
        target admin
        comment This matcher always matches
----

Matcher Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `target`: Determine which target should be notified if the matcher matches.
  can be used multiple times to notify multiple targets.
* `invert-match`: Inverts the result of the whole matcher
* `mode`: Determines how the individual match rules are evaluated to compute
  the result for the whole matcher.
  If set to `all`, all matching rules must match.
  If set to `any`, at least one rule must match.
  Defaults to `all`.
* `match-calendar`: Match the notification's timestamp against a schedule.
* `match-field`: Match the notification's metadata fields.
* `match-severity`: Match the notification's severity.
* `comment`: Comment for this matcher.

[[notification_matchers_calendar]]
Calendar Matching Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A calendar matcher matches the time when a notification is sent against a
configurable schedule.

* `match-calendar 8-12`
* `match-calendar 8:00-15:30`
* `match-calendar mon-fri 9:00-17:00`
* `match-calendar sun,tue-wed,fri 9-17`

[[notification_matchers_field]]
Field Matching Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notifications have a selection of metadata fields that can be matched.  When
using `exact` as a matching mode, a `,` can be used as a separator.  The
matching rule then matches if the metadata field has *any* of the specified
values.

* `match-field exact:type=vzdump` Only match notifications about backups.
* `match-field exact:type=replication,fencing` Match `replication` and `fencing` notifications.
* `match-field regex:hostname=^.+\.example\.com$` Match the hostname of
the node.


If a matched metadata field does not exist, the notification will not be
matched.
For instance, a `match-field regex:hostname=.*` directive will only match
notifications that have an arbitrary `hostname` metadata field, but will
not match if the field does not exist.

[[notification_matchers_severity]]
Severity Matching Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A notification has a associated severity that can be matched.

* `match-severity error`: Only match errors
* `match-severity warning,error`: Match warnings and error

The following severities are in use:
`info`, `notice`, `warning`, `error`, `unknown`.

[[notification_events]]
Notification Events
-------------------

[width="100%",options="header"]
|===========================================================================
| Event                            | `type`            | Severity | Metadata fields (in addition to `type`)
| System updates available         |`package-updates`  | `info`   | `hostname`
| Cluster node fenced              |`fencing`          | `error`  | `hostname`
| Storage replication job failed   |`replication`      | `error`  | `hostname`, `job-id`
| Backup succeeded                 |`vzdump`           | `info`   | `hostname`, `job-id` (only for backup jobs)
| Backup failed                    |`vzdump`           | `error`  | `hostname`, `job-id` (only for backup jobs)
| Mail for root                    |`system-mail`      | `unknown`| `hostname`
|===========================================================================

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Field name        | Description
| `type`            | Type of the notification
| `hostname`        | Hostname, without domain (e.g. `pve1`)
| `job-id`          | Job ID
|=======================================================================

NOTE: Backup job notifications only have `job-id` set if the backup job
  was executed automatically based on its schedule, but not if it was triggered
  manually by the 'Run now' button in the UI.

System Mail Forwarding
---------------------

Certain local system daemons, such as `smartd`, generate notification emails
that are initially directed to the local `root` user. These mails are converted
into notification events with the type `system-mail` and a severity of
`unknown` and are processed based on the global notification settings.

When the email is forwarded to a sendmail target, the mail's content and headers
are forwarded as-is. For all other targets,
the system tries to extract both a subject line and the main text body
from the email content. In instances where emails solely consist of HTML
content, they will be transformed into plain text format during this process.

Permissions
-----------

To modify/view the configuration for notification targets,
the `Mapping.Modify/Mapping.Audit` permissions are required for the
`/mapping/notifications` ACL node.

Testing a target requires `Mapping.Use`, `Mapping.Audit` or `Mapping.Modify`
permissions on `/mapping/notifications`

[[notification_mode]]
Notification Mode
-----------------
Backup jobs allow to choose between two modes for sending backup related
notifications. This is controlled by the `notification-mode` option in the
xref:vzdump_configuration[backup job configuration].

* Send notifications based on the global notification settings
  (`notification-system`).

* Send notification emails via the system's `sendmail` command to the email
  address configured in the backup job (`legacy-sendmail`). This mode also
  allows to select whether the email should be sent always or only on failure
  of the backup. Any targets or matchers from the global notification settings
  are ignored. This mode is equivalent to the notification behavior for
  {pve} versions before 8.1. This mode might be removed in a later release of
  {pve}.


Overriding Notification Templates
---------------------------------

{pve} uses Handlebars templates to render notifications. The original templates
provided by {pve} are stored in `/usr/share/pve-manager/templates/default/`.

Notification templates can be overridden by providing a custom template file in
the override directory at `/etc/pve/notification-templates/default/`.  When
rendering a notification of a given type, {pve} will first attempt to load a
template from the override directory. If this one does not exist or fails to
render, the original template will be used.

The template files follow the naming convention of
`<type>-<body|subject>.<html|txt>.hbs`. For instance, the file
`vzdump-body.html.hbs` contains the template for rendering the HTML version for
backup notifications, while `package-updates-subject.txt.hbs` is used to render
the subject line of notifications for available package updates.

Email-based notification targets, such as `sendmail` and `smtp`, always send
multi-part messages with an HTML and a plain text part. As a result, both the
`<type>-body.html.hbs` as well as the `<type>-body.txt.hbs` template will be
used when rendering the email message. All other notification target types only
use the `<type>-body.txt.hbs` template.
